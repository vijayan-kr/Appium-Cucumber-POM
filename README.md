# Appium Setup Guide (GUI Installation)

## Prerequisites

Before installing Appium, make sure you have the following prerequisites set up on your system:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)** - Make sure you have the JDK installed.
2. **Android SDK** - You need the Android SDK installed for Appium to work with Android devices.
3. **Maven** - Appium depends on Maven for building the project, so ensure you have it installed.
4. **Sample Mobile App** - For testing purposes, you will need to install the [Sample Mobile App](https://github.com/saucelabs/sample-app-mobile/releases) from Sauce Labs. This app is used for testing with Appium.
5. **Update the Property File** - In the `/src/main/resources/testdata.properties` file, update the following variable values according to your device:
    1.  `androidDeviceName`=Name of the desired device
    2.   `androidVersion`=Version of the desired device
   **For example** 
   ```properties
   androidDeviceName=Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra
   androidVersion=14
   ```

These components should be installed and their respective environment variables (`JAVA_HOME`, `ANDROID_HOME`, `M2_HOME`) set on your system. You can set these environment variables through your system's GUI settings instead of doing it through the terminal. Here's how to do it:

### Setting System Environment Variables:

- **Windows:**
    1. Right-click on "This PC" or "Computer" and click "Properties".
    2. Select "Advanced system settings" and then click on "Environment Variables".
    3. Under "System Variables", click "New" to add the necessary variables:
        - **JAVA_HOME**: Path to your JDK installation.
        - **ANDROID_HOME**: Path to your Android SDK installation.
        - **M2_HOME**: Path to your Maven installation.
    4. Click "OK" to save the changes.

- **Mac/Linux:**
    1. Open your system settings for environment variables.
    2. Add the following to the `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc` (for zsh users) file:
       ```bash
       export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/your/jdk
       export ANDROID_HOME=/path/to/your/android/sdk
       export M2_HOME=/path/to/your/maven
       ```
    3. Save the file and restart the terminal or run `source ~/.bash_profile` (or `source ~/.zshrc`).

Once these environment variables are properly set, you can move ahead with the Appium installation process.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, check the following:
